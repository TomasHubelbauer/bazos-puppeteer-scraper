# Tasks

Low-level code refactoring tasks in todo comments.
High-level project direction tasks:

## Implement check for the fetched number of posts and page-reported total

Report e.g.: "Failed to fetch the reported number of posts on the page. Expected: 20. Actual: 18" for each page

## Open detail for each post and fetch full description from it

## Persist caught errors to a log file

## Implement diff to report updates/inserts in a separate file

## Add a guide on how to hook up with `cron` for email reporting
